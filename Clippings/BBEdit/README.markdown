This BBEdit clipping set exists to make it easier for you to make BBEdit Clippings.
=====================================

I've been creating a lot of clippings lately, and I can never remember the Substitution Placeholders. So I frustratedly open the User Manual, find page 259, and die a little inside.

Then I said **NO MORE!**
====================================

This BBEdit Clipping set includes every Substitution placeholder found in the BBEdit manual. Activate this clipping set and start using the clippings to create your own clippings

About Me
=================================

Hi, I'm Ryan Wilcox. I'm a long time BBEdit user (I have a CD for BBEdit 6.1 on my shelf, and I've owned every version since then).

For a while (about 4 years) TextMate was my Every Day editor, but I moved back to BBEdit, full time, in July 2011.
